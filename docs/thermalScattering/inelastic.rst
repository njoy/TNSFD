  COMMENT: .. contents:: Table of Contents

As introduced in :ref:`scatteringLaw`, the thermal neutron scattering cross section is 

.. math::
    \sigma(E\rightarrow E',\mu) = \frac{\sigma_b}{k_bT}\sqrt{\frac{E'}{E}}~S(\alpha,\beta). 

The two steps to preparing cross sections are:

1. Calculate the scattering law :math:`S(\alpha,\beta)`. This is primarily done by the LEAPR module.
2. Use the scattering law to calculate the cross section, and prepare the final data on ENDF files. This is performed by the THERMR module.
 
For more information on these steps, please see [LINK TO LEAPR AND THERMR DOCUMENTATION HERE]


Currently, the inelastic thermal neutron scattering uses the following approximations:



.. warning::
  **What approximations are made?**
  In describing the scattering behavior with a continuous, solid-type spectrum, a number of approximations are made, which are summarized below.
